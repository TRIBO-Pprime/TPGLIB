###Autocorrelation function

The autocorrelation function \(f_{ACF}\) searches for correspondences of a surface with itself.

If the surface heights are white noise, the only shift \((tx, ty)\) that matches the original surface is \((0,0)\): \(f_{ACF}(0,0) = 1\) and \(0\) elsewhere.

Conversely if the surface exhibits “macro” features, like peaks, valleys, scratches, etc. then \(f_{ACF}\) decreases more slowly from its
maximum value 1 (reached in \(tx=0\), \(ty=0\)).

If the surface is isotropic (no preferred direction) \(f_{ACF}\) is axisymmetric, otherwise \(f_{ACF}\) has a higher decreasing rate across the pattern direction.

Therefore \(f_{ACF}\) decreasing behavior is a means to catch the direction of anisotropy when it occurs, and especially it quantifies the amount of anisotropy, as explained on
figure the figure below.

The aforementioned method needs a height \(z\) for the cutting plane. The *ISO 25178* norm suggests \(z=0.2\), however it is
not suitable (it is too low) for numerous anisotropic surfaces. We propose to average the values of \(Sal\) and \(Rmax\) for
\(z=0.3\), \(0.4\) and \(0.5\).

- (a) A typical surface to be analyzed.
- (b) The normalized 2D autocorrelation function.
- (c) Two profiles are extracted along directions #1 and #2; #1 across the scratches and #2 along the scratches.
- (d) The profile #1 (red curve) is more self repeating than the profile #2 because of shorter wavelengths.
- (e) A plane that cuts the 2D \(f_{ACF}\) surface at height \(z\), defines an ellipsis—or just a part of it—with the small axis in direction #1 and the big axis in direction #2. The anisotropy can be quantified by \(Rmax/Sal\), and the groove length by Rmax.

(\(Rmax\): semi-major axis, \(Sal\): semi-minor axis)

A complementary way of catching the decreasing behavior of \(f_{ACF}\) is to directly study its slope around
\((0,0)\), as explained below.

- (a) In each direction, the point of maximum slope is recorded.
- (b) At the minimum radius of the curve, the slopes are determined. The highest is located in \(A\) and the lowest in point \(B\).
- (c) Three parameters are built: \(b.sl=\alpha_A\) , \(s.sl=\alpha_B\) and \(r.sl = b.sl/s.sl\).
